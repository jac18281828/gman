This is a bare-bones flex+bison lexer and parser for the RenderMan(R)
shading language.  It's released under the MIT licence, so you should
be able to do pretty much anything with it.

The grammar supports all features up to Pixar's release 3.8, except for
the following feature:

	- light groups in the illuminance() statement

This grammar will probably work with AT&T yacc, byacc and their
derivatives.  I haven't tested them.  (If you have a patch, please send
it to me.)  The scanner specification, however, will definitely not work
with AT&T lex.  Lex is an extremely buggy piece of software.  Don't use
it.  Flex is much better, and it's free.

There are five shift-reduce conflicts in the parser  They are due to a
problem with the following construct:

	point "foo" some_point

After parsing the "point" token, the parser can't tell whether this is
a cast of the string "foo" to a point, or a transformation of some_point
into the point space "foo", since it only looks one token ahead.  The
problem would be fixed by looking two tokens ahead, but as luck would
have it, the default resolution behaviour is to parse this as a space
cast.  Since it doesn't make sense to cast a string to a point, this is
the right behaviour.  Well, almost the right behaviour.  What you should
get is a type error, but you get a syntax error instead.

There are five shift-reduce conflicts here because the problem happens
with `point', `vector', `normal', `color' and `matrix'.

Oh, and the grammar will require considerable tweaking to make it
suitable for a "real" compiler, but of course you knew that already.

Happy shader hacking.
